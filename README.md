# CSCI-3010-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on developing and training a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a standard benchmark in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). Through this project, we load and preprocess the dataset using PyTorch, transforming each image into a tensor and normalizing it for efficient model training. The neural network architecture is based on LeNet, a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) design tailored for digit recognition. It includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling operations, leading into fully connected layers with activation functions such as torch.tanh() and torch.softmax(). The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with various learning rates, aiming to minimize classification error across multiple epochs. Evaluation on a separate test set assesses the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, measuring performance metrics like accuracy. This project not only introduces fundamental concepts in deep learning and CNNs but also encourages experimentation with model architecture, learning rates, and activation functions to optimize performance and gain practical insights into image classification tasks.
